                           The User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design services
                             are methods of creating digital interfaces that are both visually
                              compelling and user-friendly.

                        <p>

                            App design is the look and feel of a mobile application. 
                            This includes all of the visual elements and interactive elements
                             that impact how the app functions. Mobile app design combines two
                              conceptsâ€”UI and UX. The user interface (UI) encompasses the 
                              app's look and feel.
